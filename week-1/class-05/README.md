## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to apply D.R.Y. to my code, so that I do not have duplicate and unnecessary code.
 - As a developer, I want to include images in my game, when the user guesses correctly, so that the game is more informative and fun.
 - As a developer, I want to color code the answers on-screen, so my user can visually see what answers were right or wrong.
 - As a developer, I want to host my game online so that anyone can play!!

## Technical Requirements
 - Proper use of arrays and functions when applying DRY
 - Images are correctly sized and styled
 - Color properly applied on right/wrong answers
 - GH-Pages deployment fully functional

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a developer, I want my site to look more professional, so my users will enjoy their experience (hint: Add more CSS styling to make more pretty)
