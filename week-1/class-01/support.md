### Toolbelt
If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away in lab. **Note**: Students using Linux or Windows should coordinate with the TA or Instructor who is the most experienced with those platforms (We will help identify those people).

### Design
1. Design a script (**without actually writing any code yet!**) for a simple "Hello, World" script.
2. Next, design a script (**without actually writing any code yet!**) for an extended guessing game, which asks three questions using prompts, and responds to the user using alerts.
  - The game will consist of three yes/no questions about you (example: "Did I grow up in South Dakota?")
  - The questions will be presented in a 'prompt' with user feedback in an 'alert'
  - After the three questions are finished, tell the user how many answers they got correct ("You got 2 correct answers out of 3 questions" or the like)
  - Tell the user which questions they missed (such as "No, I did not grow up in South Dakota. I grew up in Alabama.")
  - Work directory + new file

For all local file manipulation, use the Terminal and the Unix commands that you learned in class today.

Next, create a file called index.html that has all of the primary components of an HTML document in the proper structure and order: <body>, <doctype>, <head>, <html>, and <title>.

Do both by hand as a flowchart on a piece of paper (think of paper as a little personal whiteboard... what a concept!). You'll need these design for the rest of the lab assignment.  

### HTML content!
Add a new file to your folder called index.html (do this from the terminal) and create the basic HTML structure for this page using your basic building block elements (doctype, html, head, body, script, etc).

At the top of the body, inside a semantic assortment of <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags, use your own words to describe what the JavaScript on this page is doing. Strive to use proper terminology (script, prompt, user input, variable, concatenate, alert, etc.)

Think about how readable your code is to other programmers. Be attentive to code style and conventions, as much as you know of them them at this point.

### JavaScript!
Like we did we did in class, write JavaScript inside of <script> tags (placed at the bottom (inside) of the body), that does the following:

- Receives user input through a <prompt> that asks “What is your name?” and stores that input into a variable
- Returns an 'alert' box with a message that contains that user name somewhere in the middle (“Good to meet you, Homer, enjoy your doughnuts!” or the like)
- Adapt the message to something different than what we did in class
- Next, try to write the code for the three questions about yourself that you mapped out in the Design portion of the assignment.

### Add About Me Page (Create an HTML resume):
Add a new file to your folder called about.html (do this from the terminal) and create the basic HTML structure for this page using your basic building block elements (doctype, html, head, body, script, etc).

Once the framework is in place, add new elements and content to your page for the following areas of information about you:

- Name
- Biography
- List of Experience
- List of Education
- List of Goals
- A link to your Guessing Game page (Stretch Goal)
