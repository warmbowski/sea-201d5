### Tool Belt
If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away in lab. **Note**: Students using Linux or Windows should coordinate with the TA or Instructor who is the most experienced with those platforms (We will help identify those people).

### Design
Design a flowchart for making a cup of coffee, using the coffee maker of your choice, by hand on a piece of paper, using boxes for states and conditions and diamonds for decisions/conditions.

### HTML content!

For all local file manipulation, use the Terminal and the Unix commands that you learned in class today. Create a new directory for today's work.

Add a new file to your directory called index.html (do this from the terminal) and create the basic HTML structure for this page using your basic building block elements (doctype, html, head, body, script, etc).

Once the framework is in place, add new elements and content to your page for the following areas of information about you:

- Name
- Biography
- List of Experience
- List of Education
- List of Goals

Think about how readable your code is to other programmers. Be attentive to code style and conventions, as much as you know of them them at this point.

### JavaScript!
Like we did we did in class, write JavaScript inside of script tags (placed at the bottom (inside) of the body of your index.html), that does the following:

- Receives user input through a prompt that asks “What is your name?” and stores that input into a variable
- Returns an 'alert' box with a message that contains that user name somewhere in the middle (“Good to meet you, Homer, enjoy your doughnuts!” or the like)
- Adapt the message to something different than what we did in class
