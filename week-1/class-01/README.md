## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to create a static web page, so I can share details about who I am with others
 - As a developer, I want to use basic markup to structure my page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer

## Technical Requirements

 - Good use of HTML; e.g. 'body', 'doctype', 'p', 'head', 'html', 'h1', and 'title'
