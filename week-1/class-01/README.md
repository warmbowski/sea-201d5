## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to receive the user's name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.
 - As a developer, I want to provide three questions to the user, so that they can guess the answer and get to know me.
 - As a developer, I want to notify the user after each question, so they are aware whether they were correct or not in their answers.
 - As a developer, I want to notify the user at the end of the game how many questions they guessed correctly, so they can celebrate their awesomeness.

## Technical Requirements
 - Directories and file structure are organized with best practices; e.g. Folder called "class-01" and file called "index.html"
 - HTML and JavaScript are cleanly written with correct indentation
 - Good use of JavaScript; e.g. 'var', 'alert()', 'prompt()', and concatenation
 - Good use of HTML; e.g. 'body', 'doctype', 'p', 'head', 'html', 'h1', and 'title'

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a user, I want x, so that y.
 - As a developer, I want x, so that y.
 - As a designer, I want x, so that y.
