# Assignment for Class

Design and develop a guessing game that takes user input and alerts the user with status updates throughout the game.

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to receive the user's name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.
 - As a developer, I want to provide three questions to the user, so that they can guess the answer and get to know me.
 - As a developer, I want to notify the user after each question, so they are aware whether they were correct or not in their answers.
 - As a developer, I want to give the user a summary, and thank them for playing my guessing game
 - As a developer, I want to manage my code online through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others and manage my revisions

## Technical Requirements
 - A Github Repo has been created for this assignment, and cloned to the local machine
 - Directories and file structure are organized with best practices; e.g. Folder called "class-01" and file called "index.html"
 - HTML and JavaScript are cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax
 - **Add, Commit, Push** process is being followed; evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a developer, I want to add a fourth question that takes a numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low'.
