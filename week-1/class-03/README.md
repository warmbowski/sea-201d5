# Assignment for Class

Build on your Git skills, and extend your guessing game to include a fourth question and summary of the game at the end.

[Submit Your Work](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/991898/assignments/4222866)

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to work on a new branch in my repo, so I do not effect the state of my Master branch
 - As a user, I want to update my README.md file, so my repo is well documented and my sources are cited
 - As a developer, I want to validate that my user input is in the correct format, so I can accept uppercase/lowercase or shorthand answers
 - As a developer, I want to add a fourth question that takes a numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low'.
 - As a developer, I want to notify the user at the end of the game how many questions they guessed correctly, so they can celebrate their awesomeness.

## Technical Requirements
 - Branch and Pull Request to Master
 - Updated and cleanly documented README
 - Implement a new form of control flow for the fourth question
 - Implement counter to track right/wrong answers
 - Logical Operators (and possibly string methods) used effectively

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a user, I want x, so that y.
